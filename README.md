# Mastermind
A simple guesser for the Mastermind game.

I wrote this project several years ago after playing far too much [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)),
and wanted the computer to solve it for me so I could stop playing. It solves most games in 5 guesses, but may take anywhere between 1 to 6.

I may come back to this sometime and elaborate on the underlying algorithm. Please send me a message (me@milo.fyi) if you'd like to hear about it!
